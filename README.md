# Webcam Timelapse

Capturing a public webcam's footage every X seconds, and creating a time-lapse with it.

My idea is to capture the first ever snowfall in the local ski resort, Cypress Mountain and create a 10~15 second animated gif with a time-lapse using these images.

The input is a collection of images ranging from the first to the second here:

And the result is this:
